## Research
I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. within the [MARACAS](https://team.inria.fr/maracas/) team at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr) Lyon, France, since November 2024.  
- Thesis title: Deep Learning for Radio Signal Classification
- Doctoral School: [ED160 EEA](https://edeea.universite-lyon.fr)
- Funded by [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr) and the French Defence Procurement Agency ([DGA](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga))

### Thesis Overview

My research investigates how deep learning can be used to automatically recognize and characterize radio signals. The goal is to predict key transmission parameters—such as carrier frequency, bandwidth, and modulation scheme—directly from raw waveform data.

By combining advanced neural architectures with modern signal processing, this work aims to enable adaptive communication receivers capable of operating in complex and dynamic radio environments.

To this end, I design realistic datasets using the [CorteXlab](https://cortexlab.fr/) testbed. The overarching goal is to contribute to next-generation intelligent spectrum monitoring and sensing systems.
