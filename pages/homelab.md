# Projects

## Home automation
This technology allows me to :
- Monitor solar panel production
- Monitor vital environmental metrics (temperature and relative humidity)
- Monitor soil moisture of a <a href="https://andrea-joly.fr/projects/indoorgarden">indoor garden </a> 
- Control dishwasher
- Control connectds TVs
- ... 

## Self-Hosted Tools

I've set up and maintained a collection of self-hosted tools on my Homelab. These tools have not only empowered me to streamline various tasks but have also fostered collaborative work and resource optimization.

- **JupyterHub**: I've deployed a JupyterHub on my Homelab, which allowed me to offload computational tasks from my personal computer during coursework. It also facilitated collaboration with colleagues.
- **Pi-hole**: It serves as a network-wide ad blocker, effectively blocking unwanted ads across all devices on my home network. Furthermore, it offers local DNS resolution management, enhancing security and privacy while maintaining a fast and efficient DNS resolution process.
