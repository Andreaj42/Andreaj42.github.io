# **HomeLab**
My Homelab is more than just a technological hobby. It's my digital playground, where I explore, learn and create. In this section, I share the hardware and software I use, demonstrating my devotion to technological innovation and learning.


# Hardware
## Servers
**Server Rack Dell PowerEdge R730**
- Under construction 

**Server Rack Dell PowerEdge R720**
- 2 * Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2609 4-Core 2.40 GHz
- 72 Go RAM DDR3
- 6 To SSD

**Switch Dell PowerConnect 2848**
- 48 10/100/1000BASE-T ports
- 4 ports SFP

## 3D Printers
**Creality Ender 3 Pro**
- Remote-controlled by a Rasberry Pi 4 Model B

# Software

## Operating Systems
- **Proxmox VE 8.0**: A free virtualization solution based on the Linux hypervisor KVM, it also offers a container solution with LXC.
- **OctoPi 1.0.0**: A Debian image for the Raspberry Pi that already includes OctoPrint and MJPG-Streamer for live viewing of prints and timelapse video creation.

## Self-Hosted Tools

I've set up and maintained a collection of self-hosted tools on my Homelab. These tools have not only empowered me to streamline various tasks but have also fostered collaborative work and resource optimization.

- **JupyterHub**: I've deployed a <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub">JupyterHub</a> on my Homelab, which allowed me to offload computational tasks from my personal computer during coursework. It also facilitated collaboration with colleagues.
- **Pi-hole**: It serves as a network-wide ad blocker, effectively blocking unwanted ads across all devices on my home network. Furthermore, it offers local DNS resolution management, enhancing security and privacy while maintaining a fast and efficient DNS resolution process.
- **GitHub Runners**: These runners empower my continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) workflows, allowing me to build, test, and deploy my projects with speed and flexibility. By running these runners on my Homelab, I have greater control over my development pipeline, ensuring resource optimization for my projects.

## Other Tools
- **Tailscale**: For seamless and secure remote access to my home network, I use on <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>, a versatile and user-friendly VPN solution. By incorporating Tailscale into my network infrastructure, I've gained the flexibility and reliability needed to stay connected and in control, regardless of my physical location.
