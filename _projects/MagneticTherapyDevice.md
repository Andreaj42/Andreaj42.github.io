# Magnetic therapy device

For my HND internship, I developed a prototype of a magnetotherapy device for the R&D department of Auris.

The project had three main focuses:

- Design of the electronic circuit to generate pulsed magnetic fields from coils.
- Development of a mobile application allowing the user to control the device. To do this, I programmed an application in Xamarin (C# & XAML).
- Set up an embedded system (using Arduino-type boards) acting as an intermediary between the coils and the mobile application.

This experience highlighted my skills in R&D, electronics, embedded system design and mobile development.
