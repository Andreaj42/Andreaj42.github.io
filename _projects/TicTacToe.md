# Tic-Tac-Toe
Developed a sophisticated Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and Tkinter during a collaborative 3-hour pair programming session in a classroom setting. Leveraged Tkinter's powerful GUI capabilities to create an engaging user interface, while employing efficient Python coding practices. The project showcased my ability to collaborate effectively, write clean code, and implement a classic game with a modern twist.
