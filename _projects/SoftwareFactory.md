**L'Usine Logicielle : Together, let's write free lines for an open world!**

Founded in July 2023, "L'Usine Logicielle" is a passionate association dedicated to promote the world of open-source software development. With a team of four members, we are on a mission to promote and advance the cause of open-source software through collaborative software development projects and knowledge sharing.

One of the key aspects that sets "L'Usine Logicielle" apart is our belief in the power of collaboration. Our projects serve not only to improve our skills but also to contribute to the open-source ecosystem.

Our development process is rooted in transparency and community engagement. We host our code repositories on GitHub, where they start as private repositories during the Proof of Concept (PoC) phase. Once the PoC is successfully completed, we turn these repositories to the public, allowing anyone to view, use, and contribute to our codebase.

As of now, "L'Usine Logicielle" has embarked on a variety of exciting projects. These include developing a comprehensive website to showcase our association, creating solutions for monitoring Docker containers, and more. While these larger projects serve as our core focus, they also provide us with opportunities to improve our skills in areas such as configuring GitHub runners and managing DNS resources.

At "L'Usine Logicielle", we believe that open-source software is not just about code; it's about collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to a world where knowledge and technology are freely accessible to all.
