- title: Internship, Auris
  from: 2021
  to: 2021
  description: 10-week internship at Auris, a company specialised in the sale of magnetic therapy devices. In the R&D department, 
               I participated in the design of a new magnetic therapy device. This mission led me to develop an embedded system on Arduino, 
               to program a mobile application to control the device, as well as to create an electrical circuit to manage 
               the power supply of the coils emitting the pulsed fields.
